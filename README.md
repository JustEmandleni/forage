# Forage
</br></br>
University presents a challenging landscape for most students, especially within the first year of study. Students often find themselves unprepared for many of the hurdles that they encounter, most of which are not directly related to coursework but have an impact on their level of academic productivity. For a first year student, fostering academic independence and responsibility is a crucial step in character building, yet some students do not transcend quickly enough to adapt into their new environment. At Nelson Mandela University, particularly within the Department of Computer Science, there are more than enough computing resources, but problems arise when they are all in demand at the same time. On the other hand, there is an immense amount of academic workload upon students such that tutors are most certainly always in high demand yet there are no tools to aid in the search for such valuable, scarce
resources. In response to this problem, we came up with an idea to create an information system called FORAGE, which attempts to streamline student productivity and facilitate access to academic
assistance from the right people. We understand that time is of tremendous value to every student hence the main objective of this project is to be a highly accessible information system
that delivers in a timely manner. The purpose of the system is to simulate remote access to computer lab activity in real-time and leverage the needs of students that require academic assistance to connect with
competent and eligible tutors. Upon using the system, users must be able to: </br>
* Search for a machine. A user must be able to determine whether there is a lecture
within the selected lab. A user must be able to view the restriction criteria of a lab and
determine if the module facilitator allows gate crushers to occupy machines if the lab
is not used to its capacity.</br>
* Determine how many machines are occupied within a lab and where exactly they are
located. This represents the machines a user cannot sign in on a table layout slash floor plan.</br>
* Find an ideal tutor. A user must be able to compare tutors based on ratings,
reviews, backgrounds, and fees charged.</br>
* Request tutorials. A user of the system must be able to request tutorial sessions
at times that the involved parties agree.</br>
* Provide feedback. A student user must be able to add a review to a tutorâ€™s profile,
which reflects on their overall capability.</br>
* Keep track of students, tutors and computer labs. A special user must be able to
control access, the list of tutors and which courses they may tutor for, and monitor
computer lab activity.</br></br>

The contribution of this project is at least twofold: the end-user is provided with either a
computer machine or an ideal tutor. On the other hand an administrative user is provided with
close contact reports that can be used in planning and forecasting aside from the conventional application data maintenance tasks.</br></br>
